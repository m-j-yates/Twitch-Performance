# Twitch-Performance
# 🎮 Twitch Analytics & Revenue Tracker (Jul–Sept 2025)

Welcome to my data-driven breakdown of Twitch performance across July to September 2025. This Excel project transforms my raw streaming metrics into actionable insights—tracking viewer engagement, revenue trends, and platform performance with precision and creativity. After initial exploration of the raw data we will move on to how viewership is affected by personal presentation using Tableau and then finishing on an exploration of the numerical variables such as time spent streaming, overall follower statistics and unique vs returning viewers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This workbook is a showcase of my ability to turn granular data into strategic dashboards. From formula-driven calculations to dynamic pivot tables, I’ve built a tool that not only analyzes but empowers decision-making my content creation and potential future marketers alike.

# 🎮 My Twitch Viewership: Makeup vs. No Makeup

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

Using my actual Twitch viewership data, I explored three distinct presentation styles:
- **High Personal Effort**: Streams where I wore makeup, hair extensions.
- **Natural**: Streams where I went natural
- **Outfit Cut**: Exploring any effect top cut has on viewership

The dashboard visualizes how these choices influenced audience size, engagement, and overall performance.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Side-by-Side Bar Charts** to highlight viewer count differences  
- **Interactive Filters** to explore by different personal presentation 
- **Color-Coded Visuals** that reflect mood and contrast  
- **Tooltips** with stream-specific metrics like viewer engagement and days of the week

## 💡 What I Discovered

- Makeup often correlated with higher initial viewership—but not always sustained  
- Some of my most engaged audiences came from no-makeup streams  
- The data reveals subtle patterns in audience behavior and expectations  

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As both a streamer and data analyst, I wanted to turn my own stats into a story. This dashboard blends **personal insight** with **analytical rigor**, showing how even small choices can have measurable impact.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** for dashboard design and publishing  
- **Excel** for cleaning and structuring my Twitch data  
- **Markdown** for documentation and portfolio polish  

## 🚀 What I’m Proud Of

- Turning raw stream data into a meaningful narrative  
- Designing visuals that are both personal and professional  
- Using analytics to reflect on my own content and growth
